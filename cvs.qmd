## WIPPER and the intro

- [ ] Introduce yourself and shake hands
- [ ] Washing of hands and appropriate hand hygiene
- [ ] Asking for permission
- [ ] Ensuring the room's privacy
- [ ] Ensuring the environmental warmth and good lighting conditions
- [ ] Asking for appropriate exposure (**from the waist and above**)
- [ ] Asking the patient to be in the appropriate position (**semi-sitting at 45 degrees in bed**)
- [ ] Relocating to the right side of the patient
- [ ] Asking for a chaperon
- [ ] "I have all of my equipment's"

## General look of the patient

- [ ] **Consciousness, alertness and orientation** of the patient to time, place and person (After asking the [3 questions](miscellaneous.qmd))
- [ ] Comment on the patient's **position and comfort**
- [ ] Comment on the patient's **external devices** status (No oxygen masks, nebulizers etc.)
- [ ] Comment on **respiratory rate (Not tachypneic)**, **respiratory distress**
- [ ] Comment on **cyanosis**
- [ ] Comment on **edema**

## Vital Signs

- [ ] Make sure you know the [6 vital signs](miscellaneous.qmd)

## Hands - Inspection

Starting with the hand

- [ ] No **cyanosis**
- [ ] No **pallor**
- [ ] No **palmar erythema**
- [ ] No **petechial rash**
- [ ] No **Xanthomata** (Hyper-lipidemia)
- [ ] No **Janeway lesions** (painless, thenar region) (Infective endocarditis)
- [ ] No **Osler's nodes** (painful, tip of fingers) (Infective endocarditis)
- [ ] No **tar staining**
- [ ] No **IV drug abuse signs**

Moving on to the nails

- [ ] No **finger clubbing**
- [ ] No **splinter hemorrhages** (Infective endocarditis)

End this section by examining for tremor

- [ ] Examine for **fine tremor**

## Hands - Palpation

- [ ] Check hands' **temperature, dry/sweatiness**
- [ ] Check **Capillary refill** (<2 seconds is a normal capillary refill time)

Check pulses bilaterally, details below  
All pulses are done with 2 fingers, **except for radial;**

## Radial pulse

- [ ] Radial pulse; **using 3 fingers**, **lateral to flexor carpi radialis**, after 1 minute (do 15sec), comment on the rate, rhythm, volume, character and compressibility.
- [ ] Check both radial pulses simultaneously to assess "**Radio-radial delay**", a sign for aortic dissection
- [ ] Check radial and femoral pulses simultaneously to assess "**Radio-femoral delay**", a sign for aortic coarctation (ONLY MENTION)
- [ ] Calculate **pulse deficit**, we don't do this during exams (mention it), but a difference of **+10 BPM** is abnormal (Associated with atrial fibrillation)
- [ ] Now ask the patient about shoulder pain first, if none is present, **elevate hand above level of patient's head while checking the radial pulse**, to check for "**Collapsing pulse**" (Aortic regurgitation)
- [ ] Don't forget to comment your findings, mention the HR measured, regular rhythm, normal volume, normal character, compressible, no radio-radial/radio-femoral delays, no pulse deficit, no collapsing pulse.

## Brachial pulse

- [ ] Using **2 fingers**, assess the brachial pulse **medial to the biceps tendon** in antecubital fossa. (Bilaterally)
- [ ] Mention rate, rhythm, volume, character and compressibility

## Carotid pulse

- [ ] Using **2 fingers**, gently assess the carotid pulse **anterior to sternocleidomastoid near the jaw**.
- [ ] Bilaterally, `but never feel both sides at the same time` as that might trigger vasovagal attack, comment on rate, rhythm, volume, character and compressibility
- [ ] Ask the patient to **hold his breath**, and auscultate for the bruit
- [ ] Comment on the bruit

#### Femoral (mention only), posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis are done in PVS. We do them if the station was a focused pulses station

## Face

- [ ] Check eyelids for **xanthelasmata** (Hyper-lipidemia)
- [ ] Check iris for **corneal arcus** (Hyper-lipidema)
- [ ] Check conjunctiva for **pallor and petechial hemorrhage** (Infective endocarditis)
- [ ] Mention that you need **fundoscopy** to check for **roth spots** (Infective endocarditis), or **HTN/DM changes**
- [ ] Check for **malar flush** on cheeks (Mitral valve stenosis)
- [ ] Check for any signs of **central cyanosis** (Under the tongue), **peripheral cyanosis** (On the lips)

## JVP Examination

As JVP is very important and might be a full station on its own, make sure you're ready for it.

### Inspection

- [ ] Rest the patient's head on a pillow (Make sure its rested, we need a relaxed sternocleidomastoid), ask him to **turn his head slightly to the left**, using a torch, try to find JVP pulsation.
- [ ] Comment, **double peaked, inward pulsating JVP**

### Palpation

- [ ] After doing the [usuals for any palpation](miscellaneous.qmd), try to palpate it

JVP is **normally impalpable**, so make this comment and move on

- [ ] **Compress the root of the neck, JVP should disappear**, comment that it disappeared after compressing root of the neck
- [ ] Ask the patient to **lie flat → Increased JVP** (comment)
- [ ] Ask the patient to **sit straight → Decreased JVP** (comment)
- [ ] Ask the patient to take a **deep inspiration → Decreased JVP** (comment)
- [ ] Check **abdominojugular reflux**, press (**while gradually increasing pressure**) on the Rt upper quadrant for 30 seconds (don't do full 30 of course), on a positive test (normally positive), **JVP increases** (comment whether positive or negative reflux)

### Measuring JVP

- [ ] Use a ruler, put it on the sternal angle (Straight with the ground not patient's body), assess using a straight object that's put on the highest pulsation you see of the JVP, measure on the ruler and add 5cm and comment on the measured JVP (**Normally it's <9cmH20**)

## Precordium Examination

### Inspection

From the foot of the bed;

- [ ] First ask the patient to take a deep breath
- [ ] Comment "**Symmetrical chest with no visible deformities, bilateral movement of chest with respiration**"

From the right side of the pt;

- [ ] Check for **scars**, make sure you know what scars mean;  
  1. **Midsternotomy** is for **CABG**  
  2. **Left submammary** is for **mitral valvotomy**  
  3. **Infraclavicular** is for **pacemakers**  
  And mention **no scars**
- [ ] Mention **no swellings, visible masses, dilated veins.**
- [ ] Mention **normal hair distribution**
- [ ] Using the **torch**, mention afterwards that you see **no visible pulsation/no visible apex beat**

### Palpation

- [ ] Do the [usuals for palpation](miscellaneous.qmd)
- [ ] Generally palpate the chest, don't miss any point, use your whole hand
- [ ] Comment **no palpable masses, no tenderness**

**Apex beat**

- [ ] Try to find it using your **whole hand**
- [ ] Try to find it using **2 fingers** (roll the patient to the left side if you couldn't find it)
- [ ] Locate it → which intercostal space, is it midclavicular?
- [ ] Comment; **gently tapping apex beat, located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.**

**Heaves**

- [ ] Using your **hand's heel**, ask the patient to expire and hold his breath, assess both **right ventricular heave (lower left sternal angle)**, and **left ventricular heave (apex, hence "apical heave")**
- [ ] Comment! **No right or left ventricular heaves**

**Thrills**

- [ ] Using your **flat fingers**; not the tips nor the base, check for thrills in 4 locations; apex, parasternal, right and left second intercostals.
- [ ] Comment! **No thrills**

### Auscultation

![Auscultation spots](cvs10.png)

Differentiate S1/S2 by **feeling carotid pulse while auscultating the patient**

- First, with the diaphragm, 4 valvular spots and 2 radiation spots
  - [ ] 4 Valvular spots, **mitral, tricuspid, aortic and pulmonary**
  - [ ] 1 Carotid, for **radiation of aortic stenosis**
  - [ ] 1 Left axilla, for **radiation of mitral regurgitation**

- Second, with the bell, 4 spots
  - [ ] 4 Valvular spots (some only use the bell for mitral and tricuspid, you'll not be penalized for more spots anyway)

- Last, finish with 2 maneuvers
  - [ ] **Aortic regurgitation**, using the diaphragm, ask the patient to sit straight and then lean forward, examine (aortic area), and **Erb's area**.
  - [ ] **Mitral stenosis**, using the bell, ask the patient to roll to his left side and then put the bell on the apex.
  - [ ] Comment on the whole auscultation; "**Normal S1,S2, no S3,S4, normal physiological splitting of S2, no murmurs, no added sounds like opening snap, ejection click or friction rub**"

## Ending the station

![](cvs12.png)

- [ ] I will auscultate **lung bases for crackles** (Heart failure - Pulmonary edema)
- [ ] I will examine the **abdomen for ascites; hepatomegaly, sacral edema**
- [ ] I will examine **lower limb for edema, ulcers, pulses**
