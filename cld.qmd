Deeply focus on **points** in **bold**.

## WIPPER and the intro

-   [ ] Introduce yourself and shake hands
-   [ ] Washing of hands and appropriate hand hygiene
-   [ ] Asking for permission
-   [ ] Ensuring the room’s privacy
-   [ ] Ensuring the environmental warmth and good lighting conditions
-   [ ] Asking for appropriate exposure (from the **xiphisternum** to the **symphysis pubis**) (nipples to mid thigh originally)
-   [ ] Asking the patient to be in the appropriate position (flat with $1$ or $2$ pillows \~ around $10-15$ degrees)
-   [ ] Relocating to the right side of the patient
-   [ ] Asking for a chaperon
-   [ ] “I have all of my equipment's”

## General look of the patient

-   [ ] **Consciousness, alertness and orientation** of the patient to time, place and person (After asking [*the* $3$ questions)](miscellaneous.qmd)
-   [ ] Comment on the patient’s position and comfort
-   [ ] Comment on the patient’s **external devices** status, such as \~ stomas, drains, catheters, etc
-   [ ] Patient is not in respiratory distress, not tachycardic, if he's cachectic or obese

## Vital signs

-   [ ] Make sure you know the [$6$ vital signs](miscellaneous.qmd)
-   [ ] Take height and weight to calculate BMI and assess nutritional status

## Hands

Starting with a quick glance at the nails:

-   [ ] No **finger clubbing**
-   [ ] No **koilonychia** (*IDA*), **leukonychia** (*Hypoalbuminemia*)  
      
_[Mention **Terry’s Nails**, type of apparent leukonychia, characterized by ground glass opacification of nearly the entire nail]_

Moving to the still-hand examination:

- [ ] No **dupuytren’s contracture** (Alcohol-related CLD)
- [ ] No muscle wasting
- [ ] No **palmar erythema**
- [ ] No **Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy** (clubbing + periostitis of hand joints)
- [ ] No marks of **I.V drug abuse**

Palpation + tests:

- [ ] Palpate temperature and dryness/sweatiness (bilaterally)
- [ ] Test for **flapping tremor (Asterixis)** (don’t apply resistance!)

## Face

**Eyes**

- [ ] Retract upper eyelid → no **jaundice**
- [ ] Examine conjunctiva → no **pallor**

**Cheeks & Lips**

- [ ] No **sialadenitis/sialadenosis** (parotid swelling; chronic alcohol abuse)
- [ ] No **spider nevi** (better mentioned on chest)

**Mouth**

- [ ] No **halitosis** (*Fetor hepaticus*)

## Neck

- [ ] Mention examining the JVP (will be skipped)
- [ ] Mention examining the cervical lymph nodes (will be skipped)

## Chest
- [ ] Normal hair distribution (no **hair loss**)
- [ ] No **scratch marks**
- [ ] No **spider nevi**
- [ ] No **gynecomastia** (male) / **breast atrophy** (female)

## Abdominal Exam

### Inspection – Foot of the Bed

- [ ] **Contour** (flat, protuberant, scaphoid)  
_In CLD → **distended abdomen** due to **ascites**_

### Inspection – Right Side

- [ ] No distended veins (**Caput medusae**)
- [ ] No **bruising**

### Palpation & Percussion
**Tips:**

- Palpate and percuss organs systematically with respiration.
- Normal liver span: 6–12 cm.
- Spleen → percuss ribs 9–11 (normally dull, non-ballottable).


### Liver – Palpation
- [ ] Start at RIF, move 1 cm at a time with inspiration/expiration.
- [ ] If found → comment (smooth, sharp, non-tender edge).  
- [ ] If not found → percuss upwards.

### Liver – Percussion
- [ ] Ask for breath hold (after full expiration).
- [ ] During expiration, percuss down from the 2nd intercostal space to the point of dullness.
- [ ] Measure span (6–12 cm normal, **no hepatomegaly**).

### Spleen – Palpation
- [ ] Start from RIF diagonally, normally impalpable.
- [ ] Roll patient and palpate again from umbilicus.
- [ ] Impalpable spleen; **no spleenomegaly**.

### Spleen – Percussion
- [ ] Percuss ribs 9–11 → normal dullness.

## Ascites Assessment
Three tests:

1. **Shifting dullness**  
   - Percuss midline → flank dullness  
   - Roll patient (wait 15s) → **no shifting dullness**

2. **Fluid thrill**  
   - Hand on midline, flick other side  
   - **No transmitted thrill**
   
3. **Succussional splash** (mention only)

## Auscultation
- [ ] Auscultate over liver, spleen  
- [ ] No friction rub

## Ending the Station
- [ ] Examine **external genitalia** _(atrophy)_  
- [ ] Examine **PR (anorectal varices)**  
- [ ] Examine **lower limb for edema, hair loss**  
- [ ] Check **sacral edema**

### Hepatic Encephalopathy
We assess grade using **West Haven Criteria**:
