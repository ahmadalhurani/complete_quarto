#### Palpation

- [ ] Do the usuals for palpation
- [ ] Comment on no tenderness over the eyes

#### Tests to Mention

- [ ] "I will assess visual acuity using Snellen's chart"
- [ ] "I will assess color vision using Isihara plates"
- [ ] "I will assess macular sparing using Amsler's grid"
- [ ] "I will do fundoscopy examination for things like optic disk examination, papilledema etc."

### Pupillary Reflexes Tests

- [ ] Dim the room and check the pupils' size for anisocorea
- [ ] Ask the patient to fixate his eye on a distant point
- [ ] Get your torch, slide it horizontally to one eye, notice "Direct" reflex, then look at the other eye for "Indirect/consensual" reflex
- [ ] Comment on intact direct and indirect pupillary reflexes
- [ ] While patient is fixating, put your finger ~15cm in front, ask him to focus on it and notice "Convergence"
- [ ] Comment on normal accommodation reflex

### Visual Field Tests

- [ ] Ask the patient to look at your eyes
- [ ] Hold 1 hand at full extent, wiggle fingers and ask if patient sees movement
- [ ] Test at 2, 4, 8 and 10 o'clock positions
- [ ] Comment no homonymous visual field defect
- [ ] For sensory inattention: hold both hands at 2 and 10 o'clock, wiggle one then both
- [ ] Comment no sensory inattention

### Peripheral Visual Fields (one eye at a time)

- [ ] Perform 1 eye closing maneuver
- [ ] Ask patient to look at your eyes
- [ ] Test each quadrant (2,4,8,10 o'clock) with finger wiggling
- [ ] Test the other eye
- [ ] Comment no peripheral visual field defects

### Color Desaturation

- [ ] Show red object to ensure patient sees it red
- [ ] Perform 1 eye closing maneuver
- [ ] Place red object in front of open eye, ask about color
- [ ] Test the other eye
- [ ] Comment "No red desaturation"

### Central Visual Field

- [ ] Perform 1 eye closing maneuver
- [ ] Ask patient to look at your eyes
- [ ] Move red object from side to center until color is noticed
- [ ] Test the other eye
- [ ] Comment no central visual field defects

### Blind Spot

- [ ] Perform 1 eye closing maneuver
- [ ] Ask patient to look at your eyes
- [ ] Move red object horizontally until it disappears
- [ ] Test the other eye
- [ ] Comment on normal blind spot size

## Ocular Movement Nerves (3rd, 4th, 6th)

- [ ] Ask patient to fix head and only move eyeballs following your finger
